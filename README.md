# EnigmaDesktop
Encrypting desktop application using pseudo Enigma cypher. Pure Java for back-end and JavaFX for front-end. MVC architecture. One of the first projects during studies.

Software uses only redeable ASCI characters so do not worry that after copying you will loss information.

Instead of typing, you can also use txt encoding. New file will be saved in the same direction as given one.

Not the best visually but working :)
